# Sync Branches Action

Automated branch synchronization that keeps a target branch (for example `main`) in sync with a source branch (for example `develop`).

## Features

- **Automatic triggers**: Runs on every push to source branch or manual dispatch
- **Clean merges**: Direct push to target branch when no conflicts exist
- **Conflict handling**: Opens or updates fallback PR and fallback issue artifacts for manual resolution
- **Idempotent**: Skips sync if source is already in target (no unnecessary merges)
- **Safer token policy**: Push-triggered runs use `github.token`; optional PAT is limited to manual dispatch
- **Policy-compliant fallback titles**: Fallback PR titles include a Jira key (derived or override)
- **Customizable**: Configure branches, labels, reviewers, and commit identity

## Consumption Modes

This automation is intentionally distributed in two modes so internal (`rdk-e`) and OSS (`rdkcentral`) repositories can consume the same behavior using different delivery models.

## Workflow Placement Rule

Always install the workflow YAML at:
- `.github/workflows/sync-develop-to-main.yml`

Do not place the workflow file under `.github/actions/`.
GitHub only auto-discovers workflow files in `.github/workflows/`.

Naming note:
- The reusable action metadata file must remain `action.yml` inside `actions/sync-branches/`.
- `sync-develop-to-main.yml` is the consumer workflow filename under `.github/workflows/`.

### Mode A: By Reference (RDK-E/Internal)

How it works:
- Consumer workflow references the shared action directly: `uses: rdk-e/app-gateway-automation/actions/sync-branches@actions-v1`.
- The workflow file lives in the consumer repo, while action logic is executed from the shared release tag.

Why this mode exists:
- Centralized ownership and rollout from one repository.
- No vendored action files in consumer repositories.
- Best fit for internal repositories that can access `rdk-e` and internal runners.

Tradeoffs:
- Requires cross-repository access to `rdk-e/app-gateway-automation`.
- Behavior follows the moved major tag (`actions-v1`) release lifecycle.

### Mode B: Install Mode (OSS/Vendored)

How it works:
- Installer/wrapper copies managed files into the consumer repository.
- Consumer workflow calls the local action path: `uses: ./.github/actions/sync-branches`.

Why this mode exists:
- Works when OSS repositories cannot consume private `rdk-e` references.
- Keeps automation self-contained and auditable in the target repository.
- Enables explicit, versioned upgrades via release bundle + lock file.

Tradeoffs:
- Consumer repositories carry managed automation files.
- Upgrades require running installer/wrapper and merging the resulting change.

## Mode A Quick Start (By Reference)

### 1. Copy The Consumer Template

Copy `actions/sync-branches/consumer-template.yml` into your consumer repo as `.github/workflows/sync-develop-to-main.yml`.

Placement check:
- Correct: `.github/workflows/sync-develop-to-main.yml`
- Incorrect: `.github/actions/sync-develop-to-main.yml`

The default template uses:
- `rdk-e/app-gateway-automation/actions/sync-branches@actions-v1`
- `runs-on: comcast-ubuntu-latest`
- `source_branch: develop`
- `target_branch: main`

### 2. Optional: Add Token Secrets

For RDK-E closed-source repos, use `RDKE_GITHUB_TOKEN` as the standard secret.
The template also supports `SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN` as a fallback.

Token precedence in template workflows is:
1. `RDKE_GITHUB_TOKEN`
2. `SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN`
3. `github.token`

Required PAT scopes:
- `contents:write`
- `pull-requests:write`
- `issues:write`

### 3. Example Consumer Workflow

```yaml
name: Sync develop to main

on:
  push:
    branches: [develop]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write
jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: comcast-ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: rdk-e/app-gateway-automation/actions/sync-branches@actions-v1
        with:
          source_branch: ${{ github.event.inputs.source_branch || 'develop' }}
          target_branch: ${{ github.event.inputs.target_branch || 'main' }}
          token: ${{ secrets.RDKE_GITHUB_TOKEN || secrets.SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN || github.token }}
```

### 4. Optional: Generate From Installer

You can generate a repo-specific workflow from `tools/install-workflow.sh`:

Default secret selection is automatic by target repo origin:
- `rdkcentral/*` repos: `SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN`
- other repos: `RDKE_GITHUB_TOKEN`
- `--secret-name` overrides either default

```bash
./tools/install-workflow.sh \
  --workflow sync-develop-to-main \
  --repo-dir ../firebolt-entos-apis \
  --source-branch develop \
  --target-branch main \
  --runner comcast-ubuntu-latest \
  --open-pr
```

This writes `.github/workflows/sync-develop-to-main.yml` in the target repo.

### 5. Single Command For Multiple RDK-E Consumer Repos

```bash
SCRIPT=./tools/install-workflow.sh
for repo in ../firebolt-entos-apis ../firebolt-players ../firebolt-entos-runtime-apis; do
  "$SCRIPT" --workflow sync-develop-to-main --repo-dir "$repo" --runner comcast-ubuntu-latest --open-pr
done
```

## Mode B Quick Start (Install Mode)

For OSS repositories that cannot directly consume private reusable actions, use the bundle installer flow:

The bundle installer renders the workflow to use the local action path:

- `uses: ./.github/actions/sync-branches`

Important:
- The workflow file still belongs in `.github/workflows/`.
- Only the reusable action implementation lives in `.github/actions/sync-branches/`.

1. Download release assets from `app-gateway-automation`:
- `sync-branches-<version>.tar.gz`
- `sync-branches-<version>.manifest.yaml`
- `sync-branches-<version>.sha256`

2. Install into the OSS repo:

```bash
./tools/install-automation-bundle.sh install \
  --repo-dir /path/to/oss-repo \
  --bundle /path/to/sync-branches-<version>.tar.gz
```

For `rdkcentral/*` repos, use `SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN` as the secret name (unless your bundle manifest specifies another default).

3. Check current state:

```bash
./tools/install-automation-bundle.sh status \
  --repo-dir /path/to/oss-repo \
  --bundle /path/to/sync-branches-<version>.tar.gz
```

4. Update to a newer bundle:

```bash
./tools/install-automation-bundle.sh update \
  --repo-dir /path/to/oss-repo \
  --bundle /path/to/sync-branches-<new-version>.tar.gz
```

5. Optional: One-command OSS onboarding wrapper (install/update + branch + commit + PR):

```bash
./tools/onboard-oss-sync.sh onboard \
  --repo-dir /path/to/oss-repo \
  --bundle /path/to/sync-branches-<version>.tar.gz
```

Managed files:
- `.github/actions/sync-branches/`
- `.github/workflows/sync-develop-to-main.yml`
- `.github/automation-install.lock.json`

Drift policy:
- Managed file drift is blocked by default.
- Use `--force` to overwrite managed drift.

## Release Then Onboard Consumers

For fastest rollout, use this order:

1. Run `.github/workflows/release-actions.yml` on `main` to publish `actions-vX.Y.Z`.
2. Confirm the floating major tag (`actions-v1`) moved to the new release.
3. Choose consumption mode per repo:
  - Mode A (RDK-E): install consumer workflow pinned to `@actions-v1`.
  - Mode B (OSS): install or update managed bundle files.
4. In each consumer repo, ensure permissions include `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`, and `issues: write`.
5. Trigger `workflow_dispatch` once to validate token and branch settings.

## Usage Examples (Mode A By Reference)

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `source_branch` | `develop` | Branch to sync from |
| `target_branch` | `main` | Branch to sync to |
| `git_user_name` | `github-actions[bot]` | Committer name for merge commits |
| `git_user_email` | `github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com` | Committer email |
| `pr_branch_prefix` | `auto-sync` | Prefix for fallback PR branches |
| `assign_reviewers` | `` | Comma-separated team/user handles for PR assignment |
| `fallback_pr_jira_key` | `` | Optional Jira key override for fallback PR title (e.g. `RDKEMW-12345`) |
| `pr_labels` | `auto-sync,needs-manual-merge` | Comma-separated labels for fallback PR |
| `issue_labels` | `auto-sync,needs-manual-merge,needs-human-attention` | Comma-separated labels for fallback issue |
| `escalation_mentions` | `` | Optional mentions added to fallback issue body |
| `notification_webhook_url` | `` | Optional webhook URL for notifications (Slack-compatible incoming webhook) |
| `notification_on` | `human-intervention-required` | When to notify: `never`, `human-intervention-required`, or `all` |
| `fail_on_human_intervention` | `true` | If `true`, action exits non-zero when manual intervention is required. If `false`, action returns success and sets `result=human-intervention-required`. |

## Token Input

| Input | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `token` | No | Auth token for push/PR operations. Falls back to `github.token` if not provided by caller workflow. |

## Behavior

### Success Case: No Conflicts
```
push to develop
    ↓
workflow runs
    ↓
merge-base check: develop NOT in main ✓
    ↓
attempt merge: success ✓
    ↓
direct push to main: success ✓
    ↓
✅ main updated, no PR created

```

### Example 4: Optional Slack/Webhook notifications

```yaml
jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: comcast-ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: rdk-e/app-gateway-automation/actions/sync-branches@actions-v1
        with:
          source_branch: develop
          target_branch: main
          token: ${{ github.token }}
          notification_webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SYNC_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL }}
          notification_on: human-intervention-required
```

Notes:
- The webhook payload is JSON: `{ "text": "..." }`, which works with Slack Incoming Webhooks and many webhook relays.
- If `notification_webhook_url` is not set, no notification is sent.
- Notification delivery is best-effort and non-blocking: webhook failures emit a warning but do not fail the sync workflow.
```

### Fallback Case: Conflict or Protected Branch
```
push to develop
    ↓
workflow runs
    ↓
merge-base check: develop NOT in main ✓
    ↓
attempt merge: CONFLICT ✗ (or direct push fails due to protection)
    ↓
create branch: auto-sync/develop-to-main
    ↓
open/update PR with labels & reviewers
  ↓
open/update issue with compare link + run link
    ↓
⚠️  Human intervention required via PR/issue artifacts
```

The fallback issue contains:
- Snapshot source commit SHA used for the fallback branch
- Fallback branch name to merge from
- Compare, run, and one-click PR links
- A manual merge checklist for responders

When GitHub policy blocks PR creation by Actions token, the workflow also writes
an explicit warning and one-click PR URL to the job summary for faster manual recovery.

By default this path fails the action (`result=human-intervention-required` + non-zero exit).
Set `fail_on_human_intervention: false` in the consumer workflow if you want a non-blocking run while still creating escalation artifacts.

### Idempotent Case: Already Synced
```
push to develop (but develop already in main)
    ↓
workflow runs
    ↓
merge-base check: develop IS in main ✓
    ↓
✅ Skip sync (nothing to do)
```

## Token Scope Reference

For branch-protected targets, use a fine-grained PAT with:

```
Permissions:
  - Contents: Read & write
  - Pull requests: Read & write

Repository access:
  - All repositories (or specific repo)
```

## Troubleshooting

**Q: The run says source or target branch does not exist. What should I do?**
- For `workflow_dispatch`, verify the exact `source_branch` and `target_branch` inputs.
- For push-triggered runs, the branch may have been renamed/deleted after the event fired.
- List remote branches with:

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches --jq '.[].name'
```

**Q: How do I test this locally with act?**
- Run act against the workflow file under `.github/workflows/` (not `.github/actions/`):

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" act workflow_dispatch \
  -W .github/workflows/sync-develop-to-main.yml \
  -P comcast-ubuntu-latest=ghcr.io/catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest \
  --input source_branch=develop \
  --input target_branch=main
```

- If the run fails with `gh: command not found` during fallback PR/issue steps, use an act runner image that includes the GitHub CLI, or treat local testing as partial and validate fallback artifact creation in GitHub-hosted runners.

**Q: Workflow runs but push fails to protected branch**
- Ensure your token has `contents:write`, `pull-requests:write`, and `issues:write`
- If you are using the template, verify `RDKE_GITHUB_TOKEN` exists (or `SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN` as fallback)
- Confirm the workflow expression is `secrets.RDKE_GITHUB_TOKEN || secrets.SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN || github.token`

**Q: PR opens but I don't want it**
- If it's just checking feature, use `workflow_dispatch` instead of automatic trigger
- Adjust branch protection rules if conflicts are expected

**Q: Why did an issue open even when a fallback PR exists?**
- The action always upserts a fallback issue on human-intervention runs for consistent triage tracking.
- The issue body includes compare and run links plus current PR status.

**Q: I need to sync multiple branch pairs**
- Create separate workflow files, each calling sync-branches with different `source_branch`/`target_branch`
- Or use a matrix job in your calling workflow

## File Location

This integration guide is stored in `actions/sync-branches/` for easy discovery.

The composite action is at `actions/sync-branches/action.yml`.

Versioned releases are published from `actions-vX.Y.Z` tags and include the action surface (`action.yml`, `consumer-template.yml`, `consumer-template-oss.yml`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `scripts/`).
